# Pawnstorm ♟️
A full-stack Chess App

**Pawnstorm** is a personal project I've wanted to build for a long time.  
The goal is to create a complete chess experience with:

- **Local multiplayer** (two players on the same device)
- **Online multiplayer** using WebSockets
- **Single-player mode** against an AI opponent

### Project Roadmap

1. **UI & Local Multiplayer**  
   Build the core chess board, game logic, and allow two players to play locally.

2. **Online Multiplayer**  
   Expand to real-time online games via WebSocket connections.

3. **AI Opponent**  
   Add a computer opponent with basic to advanced difficulty settings.
