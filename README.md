This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# Pawnstorm ♟️
A full-stack Chess App

**Pawnstorm** is a personal project I've wanted to build for a long time.  
The goal is to create a complete chess experience with:

- **Local multiplayer** (two players on the same device)
- **Online multiplayer** using WebSockets
- **Single-player mode** against an AI opponent

### Project Roadmap

1. **UI & Local Multiplayer**  
   Build the core chess board, game logic, and allow two players to play locally.

2. **Online Multiplayer**  
   Expand to real-time online games via WebSocket connections.

3. **AI Opponent**  
   Add a computer opponent with basic to advanced difficulty settings.

---

Stay tuned for updates as the project evolves!
